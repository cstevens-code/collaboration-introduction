        My name is Caitlin, and I am really looking forward to working with you

        <strong>Where are you based and what are you studying?</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        I am based in Somerset, England. I am studying Visual Communication
        full-time.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        I learnt how to code over the summer break with SheCodes Online
        Workshops. I am currently working on further developing these skills!

        <strong
          >Which of the 9 pillars of collaboration do you feel most and least
          comfortable with?
        </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        I feel most confident in my abilities to motivate my collaborators. I am
        organised and participate frequently, and I have good critical
        reflection skills.
        <br /><br />
        I am less confident in terms of engagement and innovation. I am prone to
        doubting the value of my ideas and compare myself to others.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong
          >Where do you hope to be with collaboration by the end of the module?
        </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        I hope to be more confident in myself. I want to be able to speak my
        mind and be unafraid to share ideas.
      </div>

        <strong> Icebreaker question: </strong>
